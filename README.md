- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvgenyChur
- 👀 I’m interested in climate modelling and improving of vegetation and snow parameterisation schemes of climate and numerical wheather prediction models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the model code of CLM, ICON and SURFEX models
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the developing of different land cover parameterisation schemes for climate models and estimating the output model results by Python or Shell
- 📫 How to reach me just write me email (evgenychur@gmail.com) or find me in twitter (evgenychur).
